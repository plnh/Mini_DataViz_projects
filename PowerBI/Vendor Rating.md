# Vendor Rating Dashboard Project

## Project Overview
This project develops a comprehensive vendor rating dashboard using SAP ERP and Power BI to systematically evaluate and monitor vendor performance. 
The solution creates an end-to-end workflow from data capture in SAP to visualization in Power BI, enabling procurement teams to make informed decisions based on weighted performance metrics.

## Technical Architecture
**SAP ERP** as the primary data source and transaction system, 
**Power BI**  as the analytics and visualization layer.
